zbe_minFrameRate = -1;//FPS minimum for caching means that AI groups will not cache as long as FPS is above this number. Setting to -1 sets to predefined settings (if (isDedicated) then {_fps = 25} else {_fps = 45};). If running dedicated set to something like 25-30. If running server from own PC then set to something like 45-50. If you are unsure and/or don't want to screw with this setting, just set to -1.
